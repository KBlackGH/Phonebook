This program consists of three class files, and one main method class
The main method (Menu) can store names and phone numbers, change numbers, and find numbers
The text file bst is where the data stored and parsed from
The three class files are Person, Phonebook, and BSTReferenceBased with subclass Node
Person stores a name and number
The subclass Node in BSTReferenceBased stores a name and Person object
BSTReferencedBased stores Nodes with the String as a key, using lexiographic comparisons to sort the Nodes into a binary search tree
BSTReferenceBased can return a String ready to be parsed of the preorder traversal of the tree
Phonebook uses a BSTReferenceBased object to store the Person objects, it gives Menu the ability to recieve
the string with parsable data of the tree, the ability to add Person objects to tree, and the ability to 
change and find numbers
